    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Silvana.
        \n\nI love dance and fish.
    \n\nThe kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and for definitely the ocean.
    \nFun fact is that I have a several aquariums and also a river.
    \n\nI like eating fish, too, Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish - not so much
    \nAnd sometimes i even go fishing
    \nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
    \n\nOnce., whe i was camping in Canada, and very hungry, i even caught a large slmon with my hands.
    \n\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
    \nYou should as someone else about fishing, though.\n\n</string>
